## Project design
This file contains a brief overview of our project design stages. In addition to modeling on Modelio software, we produced a mental map on an MVC model. More documents are currently being produced.

To produce this software, we follow an agile method consisting of a sprint of one or two weeks (adapted to the duration of the project).

Do not hesitate to contact us for any question or remark on this part.
